Big Thanks @dr-ni for your work. Now i can use the module in the Raspi Desktop although i use the newer dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d in the config.txt. And this without noise. I wish to sum up all steps:
I uninstalled the unworking WM8960-Audio-HAT from WAVESHARE and deleted the files that i downloaded from the WAVESHARE repo.
I made git clone https://github.com/dr-ni/WM8960-Audio-HAT in my user directory of my Raspi 4 (32bit Desktop), (attatched with the WM8960 audio module and two speakers and a 7 inch touch display).
cd WM8960-Audio-HAT
sudo ./install.sh
sudo reboot

Ignore the message "failed to load i2s-mmap" as @TobiasVanDyk mentined.
Then, in the grafical desktop of the raspi you make a rigth click on the speaker symbol and select the wm8960-soundcard. After this you can open Chromium and play a youtube video. You will hear the music, but with some noise.

The next steps will install other drivers for the wm8960-soundcard. Only a new driver, the rest should come from the repo of @dr-ni and stay.

First i run cd WM8960-Audio-HAT and sudo ./uninstall.sh to uninstall the driver from @dr-ni .
Then cd .. and git clone https://github.com/HinTak/seeed-voicecard
cd seeed-voicecard
make clean
make
sudo ./install.sh

The install.sh script above shows some errors in the midle of working. You need to reboot and run it again.

Then the necessary drivers are installed. Now you can run the install.sh from @dr-ni again, but before i changed this script a little bit. I opened WM8960-Audio-HAT/install.sh and changed this line:
install_module "./" "wm8960-soundcard" to #install_module "./" "wm8960-soundcard"

Then run again the install script:
cd WM8960-Audio-HAT
sudo ./install.sh

I think a cold boot is necessary. Finish! Now you can open Chromium in Raspi Desktop and hear a youtube video without additional noise. Thanks to above two repos. Thanks @dr-ni .
