I'm using the WM8960 SoC codec as part of a custom kernel build at version 5.10.31.

Audio playback works with Seeed's ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT after enabling a few switches that are off, and adjusting the volume

amixer -c1 sset 'Left Input Mixer Boost' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Left Output Mixer PCM' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Right Input Mixer Boost' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Right Output Mixer PCM' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Headphone',0 100%,100%

Sound capture however is very noisy, see test.wav.zip produced with

arecord -f cd -Dhw:1 -d5 > test.wav

Seeed's soundcard driver works without issue.

Found no meaningful differences in alsa settings. See asound.state.txt vs seeed-asound.state.txt.
